# Time Logger Add-On

This is an example Home Assistant plugin that sends the current timestamp through MQTT at regular intervals.
The add-on is designed to demonstrate how to create a basic Home Assistant add-on that integrates with MQTT.

## Features

- Periodically publishes the current timestamp to an MQTT topic.
- Easy to configure through the Home Assistant GUI.

   - Click on **Add-ons**.
   - Select **Add-on Store** from the menu.
   - Click on the three-dot menu in the top right corner and choose **Repositories**.

## Automation Example

You can set up an automation in Home Assistant to receive notifications whenever the timestamp is published. Hereâ€™s an example automation configuration:

```yaml
alias: test mqtt
description: ""
triggers:
  - trigger: mqtt
    topic: home/time_logger
    enabled: true
conditions: []
actions:
  - action: notify.notify
    metadata: {}
    data:
      message: "Received timestamp: {{ trigger.payload }}"
      title: test
mode: single

```
